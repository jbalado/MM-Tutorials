Since the morphological opening operations are used to segment and the morphological closing is used to fill gaps, we are going to define an SE with a geometry to:\n",

Also, to segment the vertical elements and eliminate the small area, the SE must be larger than the small area (1 m). To fill the gap, the SE must be larger than the gap (also 1m). The density of the SE is adjusted to have the same density as the input cloud (0.1 m between points), although with practice, the density can be reduced and save execution time. Finally, the SE is centred at [0,0,0], leaving 5 points in the positive direction of X and 5 points in the negative direction, all spaced 0.1 m apart."
